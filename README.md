I am Nikita, I am engaged in mobile development for iOS with Swift.
Not so long ago he passed retraining as a mobile application developer. I easily learned the syntax Swift, figured out the Optionals, and started practicing.
I like hardcoding, I hardly use Storyboards.
I like to work in a team and share knowledge, learn new things and always improve.

ðŸ”­ I am currently working at Sberbank\n
ðŸ‘¯ It would be cool to work on an interesting project in your free time\n
