I'm Dobrolyubov Nikita<br/>
I have an internship as an IOS developer at Sber in Russia, Moscow.<br/>
I started developing mobile applications in January of this year, and am trying very hard to retrain as a good iOS developer. I easily managed to understand the syntax of the Swift language and I immediately started to practice.<br/>
I like hardcoding, I hardly use Storyboard. I like to work in a team and share knowledge and always improve.<br/><br/>
